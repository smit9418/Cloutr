# Cloutr: A Decentralized Social Media Revolution

## **Vision**  
Cloutr is a next-generation decentralized social media platform that empowers creators, server hosts, developers, advertisers, and users alike. By leveraging blockchain technology, Cloutr offers a transparent, fair, and rewarding ecosystem for all participants.

## **Key Features**

### **1. Decentralized Network**
- Videos are hosted and distributed across a peer-to-peer network of server nodes.
- The network dynamically adapts to viral content by replicating it on more nodes for low-latency access.
- As traffic slows, videos recede to fewer nodes, maintaining efficient data distribution.

### **2. Content Ownership & Monetization**
- Creators retain full ownership of their content and can sell traffic rights as digital assets.
- Earnings are distributed in Ethereum (ETH) based on views, interactions, and shop sales.
- Flexible tools for exclusive content, livestreams, and personalized shops.

### **3. Live Streaming**
- Stream from a desktop app or integrate with tools like OBS via custom stream keys.
- Interactive live content drives user engagement and rewards.

### **4. Cloutr Shop**
- Built-in shop platform for creators to sell products directly.
- Transparent fee system to support the network and incentivize node hosts.
